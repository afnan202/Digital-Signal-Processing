Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a fundamental course that deals with the representation, transformation, and analysis of signals using digital computation. This course introduces the mathematical foundations and algorithmic techniques used to process discrete-time signals and systems. The following topics are covered through the repository - 


1. generation and plotting of discrete-time signals

2. unit impulse, step, ramp, exponential, sinusoidal signals

3. discrete-time convolution and correlation

4. fft algorithm implementation

5. fir filter design and implementation (low-pass, high-pass)

6. iir filter design and implementation (butterworth, chebyshev)

7. spectrum analysis of real-world signals (voice signal)

8. simple dsp application (noise filtering, echo cancellation)
